## 🪶 Overview

**FrogGlass** is a modern open-source desktop application designed for those who care about **privacy, transparency, and control** over their images.  
It allows you to **inspect, visualize, and completely remove metadata (EXIF, XMP, IPTC, GPS, ICC, MakerNotes, and more)** — all through a friendly, frog-themed interface.  

No dependencies on `exiftool.exe`, no external binaries — **100% pure Python** powered by **PyQt6**.  
Just you, your images, and a wise frog with a magnifying glass. 🐸🔍

## 🧩 Building a Standalone Executable

You can easily compile FrogGlass into a single `.exe` file for Windows.
All assets (`logo.png`, `wk.png`, `FrogGlass.ico`) are stored inside the `assets` directory.

### 🐸 Simple Build Command

```powershell
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --onefile --icon=assets/FrogGlass.ico FrogGlass.py
```

This produces:

```
dist\FrogGlass.exe
```

The result is a single executable file that can run on any system with no dependencies.
You can compress it as a `.zip` for sharing or publication.

## 🧭 Usage Guide

### 🔍 Inspecting Metadata

1. Launch **FrogGlass**.
2. Drag one or multiple image files into the main window.
3. Click an image to view all EXIF data.
4. If the image contains GPS info, press **Map** to open an interactive view.

### 🧹 Cleaning / Nuking

* **Clean EXIF** → Safe removal (preserves thumbnails, color profiles).
* **Nuke Metadata (strict)** → Absolute wipe — leaves nothing but the raw image.

### 📄 Exporting

* **Export JSON** → Full metadata in structured format.
* **HTML Report** → Beautifully formatted metadata viewer.
* You can also export for multiple selected files.

### ⚙️ Preferences

FrogGlass saves your preferences to:

```
~/.frogglass_state.json
```

These include:

* Default cleaning behavior
* Verification rules
* Report auto-open setting

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

FrogGlass was built to be **educational**, **beautiful**, and **safe**:

* No files ever leave your computer.
* No remote connections or telemetry.
* Every operation is transparent and reversible.
* The frog is curious, not creepy. 🐸🔍

It’s a digital magnifying glass that respects your privacy while revealing the truth hidden inside your photos.
